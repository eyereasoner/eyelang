The single implementation reference is [*The Art of EyeProlog*](the-art-of-eyeprolog.md).
It documents the language, built-ins, libraries, command line, JavaScript API,
examples, proofs, conformance profile, and implementation.

## Quick start

EyeProlog requires Node.js 18 or newer:

```sh
node --version
```

If necessary, upgrade through a Node version manager or the
[official Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Run EyeProlog without installing it globally:

```sh
npx --yes eyeprolog
?- use_module(library(lists)).
   true.
?- member(X, [prolog, logic]).
   X = prolog
;  X = logic.
?- halt.
```

For a persistent command, use a user-owned npm prefix:

```sh
npm install --global --prefix "$HOME/.local" eyeprolog
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
eyeprolog
```

Add the `PATH` export to your shell startup file. Do not use `sudo npm install`;
npm's [EACCES guidance](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally/)
also recommends a Node version manager or a user-owned prefix.

Run a program non-interactively:

```sh
printf 'human(socrates).\nmortal(X) :- human(X).\n' |
  npx --yes eyeprolog --proof --goal 'mortal(socrates)' -
```

## Native forward rules (`:+`)

Normal mode executes top-level `Conclusion :+ Premise` rules natively when no explicit
`-g/--goal` is supplied. `true :+ Goal` prints answers and `false :+ Goal` emits a
`fuse/1`; JavaScript `run()` follows the same rule. Strict ISO mode disables this
extension. See [*The Art of EyeProlog*](the-art-of-eyeprolog.md) for the full semantics.

## RDF, Prolog, and symbiotic knowledge graphs

EyeProlog can sit behind an RDF knowledge graph without inventing a private graph representation. [`rdf-prolog-roundtrip`](https://github.com/eyereasoner/rdf-prolog-roundtrip) converts RDF 1.2 datasets to ordinary `rdf(Subject, Predicate, Object, Graph)` facts, EyeProlog applies portable rules, and ground `rdf/4` results can be converted back to RDF.

The checked [Symbiotic Knowledge Graphs example](examples/symbiotic-knowledge-graph.pl) uses named graphs and RDF 1.2 triple terms to distinguish trusted knowledge, AI-proposed statements, and human review. Its [wide-audience companion](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyeprolog/examples/deck/symbiotic-knowledge-graphs) explains why this is a useful present-day software model for human/AI/KG co-evolution: RDF supplies shared semantic memory, Prolog supplies explicit deliberation, AI supplies new hypotheses, and people remain participants in meaning and judgment.

The same RDF → Prolog → RDF boundary is exercised by five additional checked scenarios: [cross-organization data sharing](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyeprolog/examples/deck/cross-organization-data-sharing), [explainable EV-depot configuration](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyeprolog/examples/deck/explainable-ev-depot-configuration), [operational incident response](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyeprolog/examples/deck/operational-incident-response), [software supply-chain vulnerability response](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyeprolog/examples/deck/sbom-vulnerability-response), and a [scientific evidence graph](https://eyereasoner.github.io/eyeprolog/examples/deck/scientific-evidence-graph). Together they cover policy decisions, reversible configuration reasoning, dependency-graph diagnosis, transitive SBOM exposure, and evidence aggregation with explicit disagreement.
