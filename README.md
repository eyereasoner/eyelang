EyeProlog combines ISO Prolog and W3C RDF 1.2 to turn portable rules and linked data into answers and inspectable proofs.

The book is the reference for the language, command line, JavaScript API,
RDF 1.2 support, examples, proofs, conformance, and implementation.

## Quick start

EyeProlog requires Node.js 18 or newer.

```sh
npm install --global eyeprolog
eyeprolog examples/socrates.pl
eyeprolog --proof examples/socrates.pl
eyeprolog --goal 'type(socrates, mortal)' examples/socrates.pl
```

Programs may declare their default queries with `%% goal:` comments.
Double-quoted text follows the ISO `double_quotes` flag and defaults to a
proper list of one-character atoms (`chars`), matching Trealla and Scryer.

## Portable library

EyeProlog adds 44 public library predicates to its 127-entry ISO core registry.
**All 44 are ordinary Prolog clauses** across `src/eyeprolog-library.pl` and
`src/eyeprolog-common-library.pl`; both are autoloaded in Node and the
browser. None requires host support. Other Prolog systems should load only
`eyeprolog-library.pl`, which avoids redefining their common list predicates.
Portable text predicates use ISO atoms or character lists; the
RDF tools emit lexical values as ISO atoms as well.

## RDF 1.2

```sh
node tools/rdf-to-pl.mjs --rules rules.pl data.ttl -o program.pl
eyeprolog program.pl > derived.pl
node tools/pl-to-rdf.mjs derived.pl -o derived.nq
```

See the book for RDF mappings, graphs, triple terms, reifiers, annotations,
formats, and policy examples.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eyereasoner/eyeprolog.git
cd eyeprolog
npm install
npm test
```
